# SSH and VS Code Setup

## SSH Configuration

For passwordless access to the CSCS machines, we configure SSH in our local machines with the keys MFA tools. We need to add some more configuration information in our `~/.ssh/config` file.

We configure for Ela which is CSCS's front-end machine which connects remote users to clusters within the CSCS network.

```bash
Host ela
    HostName ela.cscs.ch
    IdentitiesOnly yes
    User <username>
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/cscs-key
    ForwardX11 yes
    ForwardX11Trusted yes

Host daint
    HostName daint
    IdentitiesOnly yes
    User <username>
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/cscs-key
    ProxyJump <username>@ela.cscs.ch
    ForwardX11 yes
    ForwardX11Trusted yes

Host daint*
    User <username>
    ProxyCommand ssh -q -W "%h:%p" ela.cscs.ch

Host nid0*
    User <username>
    ProxyCommand ssh -q -W "%h:%p" daint
```

With this configuration saved, and active SSH keys from the MFA, we can now do `ssh ela` and reach:

```console
âžœ  .ssh ssh ela

We should also be able to do the same with `daint`.

Once logged into `ela`, the command `quota` reveals the storage used by the user. The command `accounting` shows the usage of the allocated node hours for both
