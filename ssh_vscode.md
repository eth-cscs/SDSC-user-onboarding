# SSH and VS Code Setup

## SSH Configuration

For passwordless access to the CSCS machines, we configure SSH in our local machines with the keys configured using the [MFA](https://user.cscs.ch/access/auth/mfa/) tools. We need to add some more configuration information in our `~/.ssh/config` file.

We configure for Ela which is CSCS's front-end machine which connects remote users to clusters within the CSCS network.

```bash
Host ela
    HostName ela.cscs.ch
    IdentitiesOnly yes
    User <username>
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/cscs-key
    ForwardX11 yes
    ForwardX11Trusted yes

Host daint
    HostName daint
    IdentitiesOnly yes
    User <username>
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/cscs-key
    ProxyJump <username>@ela.cscs.ch
    ForwardX11 yes
    ForwardX11Trusted yes

Host nid0*
    User <username>
    ProxyCommand ssh -q -W "%h:%p" daint
```

With this configuration saved, and active SSH keys from the MFA, we can now do `ssh ela` and reach:

```console
âžœ  .ssh ssh ela

We should also be able to do the same with `daint`.

Once logged into `ela`, the command `quota` reveals the storage used by the user. From `daint`, the command `accounting` shows the usage of the allocated node hours.

## Visual Studio Code Setup

Install the Remote-SSH extension by Microsoft from the marketplace.

After installation, in the settings, scroll down to the extensions and find the section concerning the one above. There activate the *Remote Server Listen On Socket* setting.

With these settings, on reload one should be able to find the hosts on the *Remote Explorer* on the left hand side.

### Connect VS Code to a Compute Node

Obtain an allocation using `salloc`. That should allocate a compute node with nodeID as `nid0XXXX`.

Now in the VS Code settings, add the nodeID along with a path where one'd like VS Code to start from in the *Server Install Path* panel in the Remote-SSH extension section.

Check in the terminal if `ssh nid0XXXX` works. If yes, then proceed to connect in VS Code using:

`Connect to Host -> nid0XXXX`.
